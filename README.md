# BALC

My current SuperCollider setup.

## Why BALC?

In Argentina, during late 80's, early 90's there was a _scene_ of hardcore and punk bands called **Buenos Aires Hardcore** [0] [1]. So, basically, this is a play on words: **Buenos Aires Livecode** (read: a joke. i don't know, it started with a file called `balc.scd`, so that.)
